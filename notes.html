    <h2>Course work as an MSc student </h2>
        
        <h4>How long is the MSc program at the University of Alberta?</h4>
        <p> The funding letter will say that the first 5 semesters are guaranteed funding. But from my experience, if you need more than that, that’s alright. Usually, we will get a TA if you need extra terms. Sometimes RA, depending on the supervisor. </p>

        <h4> How many courses do you need to do?   </h4>
        <p>Usually, all thesis-based MSc students must do five courses, one of which is Research and Teaching Methodology, which is mandatory for everyone. That leaves you only four courses.</p>

        <h4>Is there anything you need to finish your courses by a specific time? </h4>
        <p> It is advised that you will finish your courses in your first year. So, most of us try to finish our courses by the first two semesters (fall and winter), and then, starting the following summer, it's only our thesis/research work.</p>
          

        <h4> What if I don’t finish my courses in the first year? </h4>
        <p>Nothing, you can even take one course per semester and take 4 semesters to finish them and simultaneously do your research work. </p>

        <h4> How much time do you spend doing your work, VS doing work for the lab, and are you progressing at a rate you are satisfied with? </h4>
        <p> Our research work mainly begins when we have no course left. So, all your time is spent on your research work.  </p>

    <h2> TA work </h2>
        
          <h4> How many hours do you need to work as a TA?        </h4>
          <p> 12 hours per week        </p>

          <h4> Do you need to do more than 12 hours?        </h4>
          <p> The answer is no, but it is very subjective. For example, taking a course I did not take during my undergraduate studies would be hard to prepare for. So I might need more hours than the others to prepare myself.         </p>
          
          <h4> How to avoid this kind of situation?        </h4>
          <p> Before starting a term, the department will ask you to complete a form about your skills and the courses you want to take as a TA, be honest and indicate what you would like to do. If you don’t select many skills, it will not affect your funding. </p>
